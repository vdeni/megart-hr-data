# Wave 1

## Participants

Data from 43 psychology students (32 female), aged 18 to 27 (median = 19),
was collected. All students were native Croatian speakers.

## Materials

The words used as stimuli were 1000 Croatian nouns taken from the first wave
of data collection for the Croatian Psycholinguistic
Database^[http://megahr.ffzg.unizg.hr/]. For each word, a matched pseudoword
was generated using Wuggy^[Keuleers, E.& Brysbaert, M. (2010). Wuggy: A
multilingual pseudoword generator.Behavior Research Methods 42(3), 627-633], a
pseudoword generator geared
towards making nonwords for psycholinguistic experiments.
A complete list of matching words and pseudowords was randomly divided
in 10 blocks so that eachblock consisted of 100 words and 100
pseudowords.Participants completed 5 blocks in each session.
