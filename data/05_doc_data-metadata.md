# Wave 1

## Participants

Data from 43 psychology students (32 female), aged 18 to 27 (median = 19),
was collected. All students were native Croatian speakers.

## Materials

The words used as stimuli were 1000 Croatian nouns taken from the first wave
of data collection for the [Croatian Psycholinguistic
Database](http://megahr.ffzg.unizg.hr/). For each word, a matched pseudoword
was generated using Wuggy (Keuleers, E.& Brysbaert, M. (2010). Wuggy: A
multilingual pseudoword generator. Behavior Research Methods 42(3), 627-633), a
pseudoword generator geared towards making nonwords for psycholinguistic
experiments.

A complete list of matching words and pseudowords was randomly divided
in 10 blocks so that each block consisted of 100 words and 100
pseudowords. Participants completed 5 blocks in each session.

## Procedure

Participants completed a lexical decision task in two one-hour
sessions. Each participant completed the task individually.

The stimuli were presented using the E-Prime software
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Responses were
collected using the PST Chronos device.

The presentation order of blocks and stimuli within a block was
randomized for each participant and stimuli were presented without repetition.
There was a break after every block of words and pseudowords (i.e. after 200
trials).
