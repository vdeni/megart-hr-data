# Wave 1

## Participants

Data from 43 psychology students (32 female), aged 18 to 27 (median = 19),
was collected. All students were native Croatian speakers.

## Materials

The words used as stimuli were 1000 Croatian nouns taken from the first wave
of data collection for the [Croatian Psycholinguistic
Database](http://megahr.ffzg.unizg.hr/). For each word, a matched pseudoword
was generated using Wuggy (Keuleers, E.& Brysbaert, M. (2010). Wuggy: A
multilingual pseudoword generator. Behavior Research Methods 42(3), 627-633), a
pseudoword generator geared towards making nonwords for psycholinguistic
experiments.

A complete list of matching words and pseudowords was randomly divided
into 10 blocks so that each block consisted of 100 words and 100
pseudowords. Participants completed 5 blocks in each session.

## Procedure

Participants completed a lexical decision task in two one-hour
sessions. Each participant completed the task individually.

The stimuli were presented using the E-Prime software
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Responses were
collected using the PST Chronos device.

The presentation order of blocks and stimuli within a block was
randomized for each participant, and stimuli were presented without repetition.
There was a break after every block of words and pseudowords (i.e. after 200
trials).

# Wave 2

## Participants

Data from 48 psychology students (43 female), aged 18 to 25 (median = 19),
was collected. All students were native Croatian speakers.

## Materials

The words used as stimuli were 1615 Croatian nouns taken from the second wave
of data collection for the [Croatian Psycholinguistic
Database](http://megahr.ffzg.unizg.hr/). For each word, a matched pseudoword
was generated using Wuggy (Keuleers, E.& Brysbaert, M. (2010). Wuggy: A
multilingual pseudoword generator. Behavior Research Methods 42(3), 627-633).

A complete list of matching words and pseudowords was randomly divided into
two large blocks, and each large block was subdivided into 8 smaller blocks.
Each block consisted of 101 word and 101 pseudoword (one of the 16 blocks
had 102 words and 102 pseudowords). Each participant was shown 10 randomly
selected blocks.

## Procedure

Participants completed a lexical decision task in two one-hour
sessions. Each participant completed the task individually.

The stimuli were presented using the E-Prime software
(Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). Responses were
collected using the PST Chronos device.

The presentation order of the two larger blocks was randomized for each
participant. In each session, 5 of the 8 smaller blocks that form the larger
block were displayed to the participant. The order of the 5 smaller blocks was
also randomized for each participant. Stimuli were presented without repetition.
There was a break after every smaller block of word and pseudowords.
